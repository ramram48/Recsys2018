- find most played artists in these playlists
- find their popular tracks

- calculate the next track based on lstm sequence probabilities for each track in whole given playlists.
- get 10 track candidates for last track in playlist
lastly, create sparse matrix which is including seed tracks and run implicit matrix factorization.
